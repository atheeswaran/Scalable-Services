# Scalable-Services

1. Create a Microservices based application with at least 3 microservices. Each service should be maintained as a separate code repository so that 
it can be developed, deployed, and tested independently. 
2. Use a suitable database and database related pattern for these services
3. Use a suitable approach for the communication between these services (avoid high coupling between these services)
Exploring lab tools
4. Deploy all services on a single docker container
5. Deploy each service on separate docker containers
6. Run a minikube cluster on your local machine and explore various options in this. Try deployment of your application on this.

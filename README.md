**Prerequisites:**
**Install Docker:** Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download it from the official Docker website.
**Install Minikube:** Install Minikube to create a local Kubernetes cluster. You can find the installation instructions on the Minikube GitHub repository.
**Install kubectl:** Kubectl is the command-line tool for interacting with your Kubernetes cluster. Install it according to the official Kubernetes documentation.

Description =>

2. Use a suitable database and database related pattern for these services
   => Database per service
   
3. Use a suitable approach for the communication between these services (avoid high coupling between these services)
   => REST API
   => Messaging channel - RabbitMQ

4. Deploy all services on a single docker container
5. Deploy each service on separate docker containers


6. Run a minikube cluster on your local machine and explore various options in this. Try deployment of your application on this.
